# Software Engineering & Design Patterns

## Introduction to Patterns
> [!important] **Design Patterns**
> The *recurring aspects of design* are called **design patterns**.
>-  A design pattern is the outline of a *reusable solution* to a *general problem* in a particular context.
>- Many of them have been systematically *documented* for all software developers to use

A *good pattern* should :
- Be as *general* as possible
- Contain a *solution* that has been proven to effectively *solve the problem* in the indicated context.

*Studying patterns* is an effective way to *learn* from the *experience* of others.

> [!tip] Pattern description
>- *Context:*
>	- The general *situation* in which the pattern applies
>- *Problem:*
>	- A short sentence or two raising the main *difficulty*.
>- *Forces:*
>	- The *issues or concerns to consider* when solving the problem
>- *Solution:*
>	- The recommended way to *solve the problem* in the given context.
>---
> Optional components: 
>- **Antipatterns**: Solutions that fail in the given context. 
>- *Related Patterns*: Similar patterns. 
>- References*: Origins of the pattern.
