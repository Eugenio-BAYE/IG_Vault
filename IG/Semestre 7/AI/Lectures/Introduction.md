# Definitions and Concepts

## Intelligence
> [!important] Definition
> **Intelligence** is challenging to define because it manifests in various forms. By default, human beings display an intelligent behavior. What about other forms of life: animals, insect, trees. It is plausible to consider the existence of other superior forms of intelligence, though not yet scientifically proven.
> 
> Intelligence encompasses more than just cognitive abilities; it involves adaptation, learning from the environment, and applying knowledge to achieve goals.
## Artificial Intelligence
> [!important] Definition
> There is no universally accepted definition of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. The term was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 as
>>  "The science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
>
>
> Marvin Minsky further described AI as 
>> "Creating machines that perform tasks requiring intelligence if done by humans."
### AI Performance Levels
- **Optimal**: No better performance possible.
- **Strong Super-Human**: Outperforms all humans (e.g., advanced chess engines).
- **Super-Human**: Outperforms most humans (e.g., self-driving cars).
- **Sub-Human**: Performs worse than the average human (e.g., basic robotic navigation).

> [!example] Examples of AI Performance
> - *Checkers*: AI has reached optimal performance.
> - *Chess*: AI performs at a super-human level.
> - *Daily human tasks*: AI often performs at a sub-human level, like nuanced language understanding.
# Foundations of AI
## Theoretical Sources
AI draws from a wide range of disciplines, each providing foundational elements essential to the development of intelligent systems:

- **Philosophy**: Investigates the nature of knowledge, reasoning, and the mind. It introduces concepts such as *rationality*, *ethics*, and the idea of *mind as a physical system*, influencing how AI approaches problem-solving.
- **Mathematics**: Supplies the formal language needed for AI, including *logic*, *calculus*, and *linear algebra*. Mathematics is crucial for creating algorithms that model intelligence and learning.
- **Statistics**: Provides tools for *probabilistic reasoning* and *data analysis*, enabling AI to model uncertainty and learn from data patterns effectively.
- **Psychology**: Contributes understanding of *human cognition*, *perception*, and *motor control*, which guide the development of models that simulate how humans think and learn.
- **Neuroscience**: Studies the brain as an information processor, offering insights into *neuronal structures* and *learning mechanisms* that inspire the design of artificial neural networks.
- **Economics**: Introduces theories of *rational decision-making*, *utility*, and *game theory*, which are applied in AI systems that make strategic choices.
- **Linguistics**: Focuses on *language structure* and *semantics*, aiding in natural language processing and the ability of AI to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Computer Science**: The backbone of AI, covering *algorithm design*, *hardware development*, and *complexity theory*. It provides practical methods for implementing AI systems and optimizing their performance.

> [!abstract] Multidisciplinary approach
> AI's foundation lies in the convergence of ideas from multiple fields, enabling the creation of intelligent systems that mimic or even surpass human cognitive abilities.
## Abridged History of AI
> [!abstract]- Abridged History of AI
> - **1943**: *McCulloch and Pitts* introduce the Boolean circuit model of the brain, laying the groundwork for neural network research.
> - **1950**: *Alan Turing* publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," posing the famous question, "Can machines think?" and introducing the Turing Test.
> - **1956**: The *Dartmouth Conference* officially coins the term "Artificial Intelligence," marking the birth of AI as a formal field of study.
> - **1957**: *Rosenblatt* develops the Perceptron, an early neural network model capable of basic pattern recognition.
> - **1965**: *Robinson* invents a complete algorithm for logical reasoning, advancing automated theorem proving.
> - **1966-1973**: The first *AI Winter* occurs as enthusiasm wanes due to challenges in computational complexity and unmet expectations, causing a decline in funding and research.
> - **1980s**: A resurgence with *expert systems* and knowledge-based approaches. AI becomes a profitable industry, and Japan launches the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project.
> - **1985-1993**: The industry faces another downturn, known as the second *AI Winter*, due to the limitations of expert systems and economic factors.
> - **1990s**: *Neural networks* regain popularity, driven by advancements in machine learning and the rise of distributed AI systems.
> - **1997**: *IBM’s Deep Blue* defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov, showcasing AI's strategic capabilities.
